# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other key factors. The model is developed using Python in an IPython Notebook, leveraging popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for training.
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Performed feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Normalized and encoded categorical variables.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed key trends and patterns in the dataset.
- Used visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- Identified and removed redundant or highly correlated features.

### 3. Model Training
**Goal:** Train a machine learning model to predict house prices.

**Steps:**
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained various models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Applied cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
- Generated predictions on the validation set and test set.

### 4. Model Evaluation
**Goal:** Assess the performance of the models using key metrics.

**Metrics Used:**
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R²) Score

### 5. Model Blending
**Goal:** Improve accuracy by combining multiple models.

**Steps:**
- Combined predictions from different models for a more robust final prediction.
- Used techniques like weighted averaging and stacking.
- Found model blending to significantly improve accuracy, achieving top performance in the competition 🚀.
